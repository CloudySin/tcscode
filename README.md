Supplementary code for Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science book.

Use [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/boazbk/tcscode/tree/master/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/boazbk/tcscode/tree/master/) to view all the notebooks in a static version.
Use [https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/boazbk/tcscode/master](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/boazbk/tcscode/master) to view a live version on binder.

This repository should eventually contain all the supplamentary code for the book. At the moment you can see [this older repository](https://github.com/boazbk/nandnotebooks) for prior versions of the code.
